    <h1>Hello world!</h1>
    <p>Welcome to my first website.</p>
    <h2>Web Security</h2>
    <p id="web-security-question">How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web security attacks? Note: the word count for your answer should not be greater than 250 words</p>
    <p id="web-security-answer">1. Include everyone in your organization in security practices - Everyone should be aware of the threats and risk regarding security, acknowledge potential vulnerabilities and feel responsible for security 
 
        2. The organization should adopt a cybersecurity framework - a strategic approach that starts with mapping out security risk, developing a cyber incident response plan and a suitable security checklist. 
         
        A advantage of adopting a cybersecurity framework is the realization that all cybersecurity is interconnected, and web security cannot be treated as a separate problem. 
         
        3. The less manual work, the less room for error. The security processes should be automated and integrated. If security is integrated into the software development lifecycle, issues can be eliminated early. 
         
        4. Your organization should follow secure software development practices. Software developers should be educated about potential security problems.  
        Scanning for security vulnerabilities as early as possible in the development lifecycle is important 
         
        5. Use diverse security measures. The key tool for web application security is the vulnerability scanner, but the scanning must not be treated as a replacement for penetration testing.  
         
        6. Perform mock attacks, preform continuous security exercises such as red team vs. blue team, the idea behind this is to hire an external organization that tries to challenge your security and local team that is in charge of stopping such attempts 
         
        7. Establish a bounty program. Many top-notch security professionals work freelance. By offering bounties hackers will identify security vulnerabilities in your organization </p>
